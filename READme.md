 **CPU Scheduling**

**Optimizing resource allocation and task completion through strategic process management.**

**Key Concepts:**

* **CPU Scheduling:** The decision-making process that dictates which process gets access to the CPU at any given time.
* **Goals:**
    * Efficient resource utilization
    * Timely task completion
    * Fairness among processes
* **Common Scheduling Algorithms:**
    * **FCFS (First Come, First Served):** Simple, but can lead to waiting for short processes behind long ones.
    * **SJF (Shortest Job First):** Optimizes for short burst times, but requires prior knowledge of process lengths.
    * **SRT (Shortest Remaining Time):** Dynamic version of SJF, re-evaluating priorities after each process completion.
    * **Priority Scheduling:** Assigns priority levels based on factors like importance or urgency.
    * **Round Robin:** Ensures fairness by giving each process a fixed time slice (quantum) in a circular fashion.
    * **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:** Divides processes into different priority queues to address varying needs.
    * **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling:** Allows processes to move between queues based on their behavior for dynamic prioritization.
